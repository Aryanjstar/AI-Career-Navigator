# Customize tone, expertise level, and focus areas
```

#### 3. Adding New Features

**Frontend Component Development:**
```bash
cd frontend/src/components
mkdir NewFeature
cd NewFeature

# Create component files
touch index.tsx NewFeature.tsx NewFeature.test.tsx types.ts
```

**Backend API Extension:**
```python
# backend/api/career_insights.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from typing import Dict, Any

router = APIRouter(prefix="/career-insights", tags=["insights"])

@router.post("/market-analysis")
async def analyze_market_trends(
    skills: List[str],
    location: str = "global"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Your custom analysis logic
    return {
        "demand_score": 85,
        "salary_trends": {...},
        "growth_projection": {...}
    }
```

### 🔧 Configuration Management

#### Environment Variables

**Development (.env.development):**
```env
# Azure OpenAI Configuration
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-dev-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-dev-key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4-dev

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
ENABLE_PREMIUM_FEATURES=false
ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=true

# Performance Settings
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10
CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=30
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=100
```

**Production (.env.production):**
```env
# Production Azure OpenAI
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=${AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=${AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY}
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4-production

# Security Settings
ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
ENABLE_PREMIUM_FEATURES=true
ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=false

# Optimized Performance
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=5
CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=60
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=50
```

### 📊 Performance Optimization

#### Frontend Optimization
```typescript
// Lazy loading and code splitting
const InterviewPrep = lazy(() => import('./components/InterviewPrep'));
const CareerAnalytics = lazy(() => import('./components/CareerAnalytics'));

// Memoization for expensive calculations
const MemoizedChart = memo(({ data }: ChartProps) => {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => 
    processChartData(data), [data]
  );
  
  return <Chart data={processedData} />;
});
```

#### Backend Optimization
```python
# Caching strategies
from functools import lru_cache
import redis

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
async def get_skill_analysis(resume_hash: str, job_description_hash: str):
    # Expensive AI analysis with caching
    pass

# Database query optimization
async def get_user_analytics(user_id: str):
    query = """
    SELECT skill_name, proficiency_score, last_updated
    FROM user_skills 
    WHERE user_id = $1 
    ORDER BY proficiency_score DESC
    LIMIT 20
    """
    return await database.fetch_all(query, user_id)
```

```python
# Implement intelligent caching
@lru_cache(maxsize=500)
def get_cached_analysis(resume_hash: str, job_hash: str):
    # Cache expensive AI calls for 24 hours
    return ai_analysis_result

# Token usage optimization
def optimize_prompt(user_input: str) -> str:
    # Reduce token count while maintaining quality
    return compressed_prompt

# Batch processing for multiple requests
async def batch_analyze_resumes(resumes: List[Resume]) -> List[Analysis]:
    # Process multiple resumes in single API call
    pass
```

#### 2. Infrastructure Scaling
```yaml
# Auto-scaling configuration
scaling:
  min_instances: 1
  max_instances: 10
  scale_up_threshold: "cpu > 70%"
  scale_down_threshold: "cpu < 30%"
  
# Development environment cost reduction
development:
  app_service_tier: "F1"  # Free tier for development
  storage_tier: "LRS"     # Locally redundant storage
  enable_auto_shutdown: true
```

#### 3. Storage Optimization
```python
# File lifecycle management
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

async def setup_lifecycle_policy():
    # Delete temporary files after 7 days
    # Archive old resumes after 90 days
    # Move to cool storage after 30 days
    pass
```

### 📈 ROI and Business Value

#### Quantifiable Benefits
- **Time Savings**: Reduces job search time by 40-60%
- **Interview Success Rate**: Increases by 30-50% with AI preparation

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

#### Azure OpenAI Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify your Azure OpenAI configuration
azd env get-values | grep AZURE_OPENAI

# Test connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(azd env get-value AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY)" \
  "$(azd env get-value AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT)/openai/models?api-version=2024-02-01"

# Common fixes
azd auth login --check-status
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION "2024-02-01"
```

#### Frontend Build Issues
```bash
# Clear cache and dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .next dist
npm install

# Check Node.js version compatibility
node --version  # Should be 20+
npm --version   # Should be 9+

# Update dependencies
npm update
npm audit fix
```

#### Backend Python Issues
```bash
# Virtual environment setup
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.11+
```

#### Performance Issues
```typescript
// Frontend performance debugging
import { Profiler } from 'react';

function onRenderCallback(id, phase, actualDuration) {
  console.log('Component render time:', { id, phase, actualDuration });
}

<Profiler id="CareerAnalytics" onRender={onRenderCallback}>
  <CareerAnalytics data={data} />
</Profiler>
```
